1. Describe the problem generics address.
Generics address the problem of code reusability and type safety in programming languages. 
Keeps type-safety: consistency between variables
Maintainability: easier to maintain since all the variables with the same generic type 
High performance: no unwanted boxing 
Flexibility: can handle different types

2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
List<string> list = new List<string>();

3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
two generic type parameters: one for the key type and one for the value type

4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match. 
False.

5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
Add()

6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
Remove: Removes the first occurrence of a specific object.
RemoveAt: Removes the element at the specified index.

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
use angle brackets (<>) after the class name, followed by the type parameter
eg.
public class MyClass<T> 
{
}

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
False.

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
True.

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
True.
